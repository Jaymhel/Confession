    <b>I hope you're doing well. The truth is, I have a crush on you.

 Ang ganda ng smile mo and yung eyes mo at saka ang cute mo and the way you carry yourself just captivate me, and I wanted you to know how much you mean to me.

I understand if this is unexpected, and I don't want to make things awkward. I just couldn't keep this to myself any longer.

Take care, cinode kona para sayo HAHAHAHAHAHAHA</b>
